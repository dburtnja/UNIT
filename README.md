get_next_line/:

The get_next_line project, allow to read a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor.

The main purpase of this project is to allow us to learn:
static variables, deeper understanding of allocations, whether they happen on the
stack memory or in the heap memory, the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer, the
unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.
